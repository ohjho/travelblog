### Sunrise at the beach
### Attempt at Pigeon Island
Not successful. They wanted to charge 87 USD for the two of us. According to Lonely Planet lots of day trippers steps on the coral on the beach. So we decided to skip it.

### A Day in Paradise at Trinco Blu by Cinnamon
Breakfast Buffet was awesome! Diverse selection of cuisine but our favourite was their Egg Hoppers, and Hoppers with Dhal Curry. Their dinner buffet was equally impressive! We loved their even Kottu Roti and again their Sri Lankan section.

We had a stroll on the street just outside the hotel in the afternoon. **Pacific Kitchen** had some awesome **rice and curry**. Their logo was cool, music was a mega mix on loop, and their food delicious and cheap. **Cafe 18** also served some legit ice coffee.

After lunch we made use of their pool and did a workout. Their playground swings doubles easily as a pull-up bar.
